        Installation

Firstly, install pyarmor for obfuscation
    - Before every install, perform >> pyarmor gen .

    When one or packages can't install from cache

perform >> pip install -r requirements.txt

    Otherwise

pip install .

or activate virtual then install
or ...\limekit_env\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install .

        Changes to be considered

FIXED: uncommented
- Commented out "set_eventloop" method to prevent eventloop
    * Interferred with the project-runner's QApplication

        working with the code

use "py -m pip install -e ." for "hot reload"
    - This prevents from running pip install upon every modification

        method unpacking

    for def method(arg1="this", arg2="that") use @lupa.unpacks_lua_table_method
    to pass **kwargs, use @lupa.unpacks_lua_table

            Freezing (building)

        Embedding resources

    - Append "('resource.txt', '.')" to data=[]

    ** Remember to: console=False

    - Create dir for hooks/hook-lupa.py and add to file

            from PyInstaller.utils.hooks import collect_data_files,collect_submodules
            datas = collect_data_files('lupa', True)

    - Include hookspath=['hooks]
